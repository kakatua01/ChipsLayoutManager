![ChipsLayoutManager for RecyclerView. Custom layout manager for RecyclerView](/images/header.png)

## This is ChipsLayoutManager - custom Recycler View's LayoutManager which moves item to the next line when no space left on the current 
This layout manager could represent [Google Chips material design pattern](https://material.google.com/components/chips.html#)

As an android developer i see that google isn't so polite to support all our wishes, and when i faced with such common task like create spannable list
but with support of CRUD animations i decided to make such stuff and share it.

## Setup and usage
### Installation [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/beloo/widget/ChipsLayoutManager/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/beloo/widget/ChipsLayoutManager/_latestVersion)

with gradle
```GRADLE 
compile 'com.beloo.widget:ChipsLayoutManager:0.3.7@aar'
```

Assuming you have installed jCenter provider:
```GRADLE
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

or just import `ChipsLayoutManager` module to your project.

### Features
Layout manager represents chips or spanned or "bubble" structure of list items and is a good replace for typical implementations of such issue based on spans in `TextView` 
or custom `FlowLayout`s.

* supports `RecyclerView`'s/`LayoutManager`'s features, such as default animations while CRUD items & custom `ItemAnimator`s, `ItemDecorator`s, scrolling etc. `wrap_content` of height is supported
* vertical scrolling is supported. Horizontal scrolling isn't supported. It is possible to disable vertical scrolling as well. Supported padding/margin, clipToPadding parameter of `RecyclerView`
* supports different height and width of items
* recycling items support (another advantage over `TextView` approach)
* items gravity inside row support. For all items or only for required ones
* LTR and RTL support
* activity orientation change support
* predictive animations supported (animate view movement outside of visible bounds)
* setting max count of view in row
* you are able to break row due to your conditions
* justified views in row with spaces or additional view size

| Insert/delete | Move |

####Layout Directions
<center>

|  | Left to Right  | Right to Left  |
|---|---|---|
|  <b>Horizontal</b> |![Left to Right Rows implementation of ChipsLayoutManager](/images/ltr_horizontal.png) |![Right to Left implementation of ChipsLayoutManager](/images/rtl_horizontal.png)|
|  <b>Vertical</b>   |![Left to Right Columns implementation of ChipsLayoutManager](/images/ltr_vertical.png) ||

</center>

####Fill strategy
Any row has some space left, where is impossible to place the next view, because that space is too small.
But we could distribute that space for available views in that row.

Row strategy is a mode of distribution left space.

* `STRATEGY_DEFAULT` - is used by default. Left space is placed at the end of the row.
* `STRATEGY_FILL_VIEW` - available space is distributed among views.
* `STRATEGY_FILL_SPACE` - available space is distributed among spaces between views, start & end views are docked to a nearest border.
* `STRATEGY_CENTER` - available space is distributed among spaces between views, start & end spaces included. Views are placed in center of canvas.
* `STRATEGY_CENTER_DENSE` - Views are placed in center of canvas. Available space is distributed among start & end spaces. There is no extra space distributed between views.

In such layouts by default last row isn't considered completed. So strategy isn't applied for last row.
But you can also enable opposite behaviour.

### Usage

```JAVA 
ChipsLayoutManager chipsLayoutManager = ChipsLayoutManager.newBuilder()
        //set vertical gravity for all items in a row. Default = Gravity.CENTER_VERTICAL
        .setChildGravity(Gravity.TOP)
        //whether RecyclerView can scroll. TRUE by default
        .setScrollingEnabled(true)
        //set maximum views count in a particular row
        .setMaxViewsInRow(2)
        //set gravity resolver where you can determine gravity for item in position. 
        //This method have priority over previous one
        .setGravityResolver(new IChildGravityResolver() {
            @Override
            public int getItemGravity(int position) {
                return Gravity.CENTER;
            }
        })
        //you are able to break row due to your conditions. Row breaker should return true for that views
        .setRowBreaker(new IRowBreaker() {
            @Override
            public boolean isItemBreakRow(@IntRange(from = 0) int position) {
                return position == 6 || position == 11 || position == 2;
            }
        })
        //a layoutOrientation of layout manager, could be VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL. HORIZONTAL by default
        .setOrientation(ChipsLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL)
        // row strategy for views in completed row, could be STRATEGY_DEFAULT, STRATEGY_FILL_VIEW, 
        //STRATEGY_FILL_SPACE or STRATEGY_CENTER
        .setRowStrategy(ChipsLayoutManager.STRATEGY_FILL_SPACE)
        // whether strategy is applied to last row. FALSE by default
        .withLastRow(true)
        .build();
rv.setLayoutManager(chipsLayoutManager);
```

Notice that if you changed gravity resolver or row breaker conditions in runtime - it won't affect already drown items and cached item positions.
You have to call `notifyItemChanged` on `ChipsLayoutManager` otherwise layout won't be predictable. 

**Device current direction** have been chosen by default.
You can manipulate with layout direction (**LTR** or **RTL**)<br/>
_On Api >= 17:_
```XML
<android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="match_parent"
       android:layoutDirection="rtl"
       />
```
or programmatically (_on all supported Api:_):
```JAVA
ViewCompat.setLayoutDirection(recyclerView, ViewCompat.LAYOUT_DIRECTION_RTL);
```

For example look at sample application.
<br />
### Bonus
You may need an `RecyclerView.ItemDecoration` to work with `ChipsLayoutManager` for fast setup as showed in sample. <br/>
It contained in same package and named `SpacingItemDecoration`.
